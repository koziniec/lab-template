## EVE Initial configuration

This is the file that you should download and work with to complete the lab.

## EVE Final configuration

This is the configuration as it might be expected to appear after completing all the steps in the lab.  You only need to use this file for one of the following reasons:

- You really don't understand what the lab requires and you want to look at the final configuration to reverse engineer what the lab was asking you to do.
- You finished the lab but it doesn't behave as expected and after trying everything you still can't figure out what is wrong.  Comparing the final configuration to your configuration and looking at the differences may help you to close in on the issue.

Keep in mind that a final configuration is not always provided and where it is provided it may not have been thoroughly checked.  These configurations are often quickly put together to check the lab sequencing and commands and sometimes edits to the lab documentation occur that means the final configuration no longer perfectly matches the lab.  Essentially this file is a test of the documentation not an artifact really intended as a teaching aid.  Nevertheless, many have requested that I make them available.

If there are significant errors in the Final Configuration, let the author know and I will fix them as and when I can. If nothing else. I can make a post in News to highlight the issue.
