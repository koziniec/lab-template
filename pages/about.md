# About
I use these labs in support of my teaching at Murdoch University as part of one or more of the following courses:

[Bachelor of Information Technology, Internetworking and Network Security Major](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/MJ-INS)
 

Graduate Diploma in Internetworking and Security https://www.murdoch.edu.au/study/courses/postgraduate/g1059

Master of Information Technology - Cyber Security and Networking https://www.murdoch.edu.au/study/courses/postgraduate/mj-icsn

However, the labs are developed using my own facilities, in my own time (mostly after midnight!) and hosted privately using Github.
