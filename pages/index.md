# Lab Title

## Completing this lab
- This lab is intended to be completed using a provided EVE topology file.  The EVE file can be found by accessing the "EVE topology Files" link in the navigation bar on the left.  
- The file assumes that you have access to an EVE environment with the correct router and switch IOS versions.  If you are a Murdoch University student enrolled in one of the author's units you have access to this environment via a virtual machine in our data-centre or you can download a local copy and run it on your own computer.  Details for both options can be found on the Learning Management System (LMS) for your unit.

- Once you have imported the EVE topology into the EVE emulator, you are ready to work through the lab materials by accessing the "Lab Exercise" link in the navigation bar on the left.
